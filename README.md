# Evaluation Ideas

- The morphological measures from "Embarassingly simple paper" (Gianluca is implementing them)
  
- Variety of stats for a given corpus
    - how long are the tokens on average (implemented)
    - how many unique tokens do we need to tokenize a corpus (implemented)
    - how many total tokens do we need to tokenize a corpus (implemented)
    - how many suffixe / prefixe (implemented)
    - how many words without affix (implemented)
    - how many tokenizations in the vocabular overlap (implemented)
      
    - how long where the suffixe / prefixes 
    - how many tokens are actually meaningful (words, common prefixes / affixes)

    
  
- Classification over the challenge sets of the "Embarassingly simple paper" (possibly Jan Cramer)
- SmallNLP Benchmark (possibly Jan Cramer)
